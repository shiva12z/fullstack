    <p>A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing, typically consisting of multiple sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. It serves to organize and structure written work, making it easier for readers to follow the author's train of thought. A paragraph is usually indicated by an indent at the beginning of the first sentence. </p>
